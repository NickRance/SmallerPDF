# SmallerPDF
Make your PDF files great again! A super simple tool to reduce PDF file size using GhostScript.

# Intention
The main purpose of this program is to reduce the resolution of the PDF, so that you can easily share your large size PDF around online (e.g. Discord has file limit size of 8MB).
This program is especially helpful if you want to reduce the file size of a PDF that contains handwritten notes (e.g. produced with apps like GoodNotes)

# Installation
```bash
cargo install smallerpdf
```

# Usage
```bash
smallerpdf <pdf_name>
```
